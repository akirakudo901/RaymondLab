    Given a specific csv name that was analyzed, extracts a numpy.ndarray of
    frame-shifted labels stored within a 'predictions.sav' file at time of
    previous analysis. Simultaneously, extracts frameshifted data and uses it to
    compute frameshifted corresponding features.
    :param str filename: Name of csv that was analyzed in order to extract the
    labels of interest.
    :param str clf_sav_path: The path to the classifier-stored sav file, often
    called 'PREFIX_randomforest.sav'. Used to name storing files consistently.
    :param List[int] pose: A list of indices that specifies which body part is
    inscribed into the labeled feature csv as columns, in which order. Provide
    your best guess!
    e.g. [0,1,2,6,7,8] will likely use 'snout' and 'leftforepaw'.
    :param int fps: Framerate for video. Defaults to 40, given Ellen's project.
    :param bool save_result: Whether to save the computed features under
    save_path. Defaults to true.
    "param str save_path: The folder to which we save computed features.
    Defaults to FEATURE_SAVING_FOLDERS.
    :param bool recompute: Whether to recompute features saved under load_path.
    :param str load_path: The path from which we attempt to load precomputed
    features. Defaults to FEATURE_SAVING_FOLDERS.
