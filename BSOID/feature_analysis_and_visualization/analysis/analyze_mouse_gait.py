Take a single csv. From it, we can:
1) Extract all locomotion bouts
2) Visualize info:
 - How many locomotion bouts there are
 - How many of each length of locomotion bouts there are
 - What's the distribution of the distance between two locomotion bouts (curious if bouts are broken down but close together)
 - What's the distribution of locomotion for every 5 min interval (just curious)
3) Extract the paw stopping based on speed
4) For every paw stopping identified as single bout, find the average paw position within that stop
5) Graph such paw positions over time in:
 - a static plot
 - video, to confirm of its correctness
6) Save this data into a csv, and:
 - calculate the distance between each paw movement
 - calculate the distance between each body part
 and so on.
7) Visualize:
- distance traveled in a single bout
- max / min / average speed of those single bouts
- frequency of bouts with different speeds
8) Maybe do analysis based on those variables
